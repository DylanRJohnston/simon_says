# Simon Says

My first game and winning entry to the week long Game Jam: [Bevy Jam #5](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5/rate/2853129). 

Play it on [itch.io](https://dylanrjohnston.itch.io/simon-says)

## Pitch

You awake in a strange negative space, unable to move of your own free will. Something is watching, you're compelled to follow its commands.

Firefox users will experience audio stuttering on startup and at the start of some levels due to shader compilation. Chrome, Safari, or other browser with good WASM support is recommended.
